I work on a multi-talented advanced technology and innovation team. My role as a data scientist includes data munging, developing cutting edge methodologies, building predictive models, and mentoring.

<br>
Previously, I was a scientist for over 10 years. My work focused on protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions and developing state-of-the-art computational methods to understand complex biological systems. An updated list of my peer-reviewed scientific publications can be found [here](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user={{ site.author.googlescholar }}).
