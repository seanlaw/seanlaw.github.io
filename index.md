<h3>About</h3> 
<br>
I am a data scientist currently working on a multi-talented advanced technology and innovation team. I have experience producing <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz501811k">cutting edge methodologies</a>, building <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.23683/abstract">high-performance predictive models</a>, and developing rapid prototypes.
<br><br>
For data munging, analysis, and deep dives, I use the <a href="http://www.pydata.org">PyData stack</a>. However, various command-line tools can be found in my daily arsenal.
<br><br>
Previously, I was a scientist for over 10 years and received my doctorate from <a href="http://www.msu.edu">Michigan State University</a>. My work focused on <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/12067.short">protein-protein interactions</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349511011763">protein-nucleic acid interactions</a>, and developing state-of-the-art computational tools for understanding complex biological systems. An up-to-date list of my peer-reviewed scientific publications can be found [here](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user={{ site.author.googlescholar }}).
