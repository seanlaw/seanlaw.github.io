<h3>About</h3> 
<br>
I am an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanlawphd/">senior applied research scientist</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/">lead data scientist</a> currently working with a multi-talented R&D team at a Fortune 500 finance firm. I have experience producing <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz501811k">cutting edge methodologies</a>, building <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcc.23683/abstract">high-performance predictive models</a>, developing rapid prototypes, and I am an inventor on several finance-related patents. 
<br><br>
Additionally, I co-organize the monthly <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Ann-Arbor/">PyData Ann Arbor data science meetup</a> and I am also the creator and core maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy">STUMPY</a>, a powerful and scalable open source Python library that can be used for a variety of time series data mining tasks.
<br><br>
For data munging, analysis, visualization, and deep dives, I use the <a href="http://www.pydata.org">PyData stack</a>. However, various command-line tools can be found in my daily arsenal. <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> is my distributed version control system of choice.
<br><br>
I hold an Honours B.Sc. degree from <a href="http://www.yorku.ca">York University</a> in Applied Mathematics and Biology, received my doctorate from <a href="http://www.msu.edu">Michigan State University</a>, and worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>. As a scientist, my work focused on <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/12067.short">protein-protein interactions</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349511011763">protein-nucleic acid interactions</a>, and developing state-of-the-art computational tools for understanding complex biological systems. An up-to-date list of my peer-reviewed scientific publications can be found on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user={{ site.author.googlescholar }}) and my code contributions can be found on [Github](http://www.github.com/{{ site.author.github }}).
