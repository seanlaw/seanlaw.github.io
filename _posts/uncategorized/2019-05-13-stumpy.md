Thanks to the support of <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com">TD Ameritrade</a>, I recently open sourced (BSD-3-Clause) a new, powerful, and scalable Python library called <a href="https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy">STUMPY</a> that can be used for a variety of time series data mining tasks. At the heart of it, this library takes any time series or sequential data and efficiently computes something called the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7837992">matrix</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7837898">profile</a>, which, with only a few extra lines of code, enables you to perform:
<br><br>
* pattern/motif (approximately repeated subsequences within a longer time series) discovery
* anomaly/novelty (discord) discovery
* shapelet discovery
* semantic segmentation
* density estimation
* time series chains (temporally ordered set of subsequence patterns)
* and more...
<br><br>
To install stumpy:
<br><br>
{% highlight python %}
pip install stumpy
{% endhighlight %}
<br><br>
Once installed, typical usage would be:
<br><br>
{% highlight python %}
import stumpy
import numpy as np

your_time_series = np.random.rand(10000)
window_size = 50  # Approximately, how many data points might be found in a pattern

matrix_profile = stumpy.stump(your_time_series, m=window_size)
{% endhighlight %}
