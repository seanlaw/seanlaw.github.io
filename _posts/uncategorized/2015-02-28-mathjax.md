As I embark on the PyESL project, I'll need to include math equations in future blog posts. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use MathJax so that I can incorporate Tex/LaTeX/MathML-based equations within HTML. In Jekyll, all you need to do is add the MathJax javascript to the header section of your default.html and add a new variable to your _config.yml file.

    <head>
        ...
        <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
    </script>
        ...
    </head>

and add the following to your _config.yml file:

    markdown: kramdown

For example, this markdown:

    Inline equation \\( {y} = {m}{x} + {b} \\) and block equation \\[ {y} = {m}{x}+{b} \\] 


produces:
<br><br>
Inline equation \\( {y} = {m}{x}+{b} \\) and block equation \\[ {y} = {m}{x}+{b} \\]
