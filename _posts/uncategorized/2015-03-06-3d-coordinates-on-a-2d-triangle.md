title: 3D Coordinates Represented on a 2D Triangle

I came across this interesting way of showing 3D coordinates on a 2D triangle published in the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp510215c">Journal of Physical Chemistry B</a>. It takes a minute to orient yourself and figure out how best to interpret the results but the idea is pretty cool. I wonder what type of geometric transformation is need to create this plot. Once I figure it out, I'll be sure to blog about it and prototype it in Python!
