The qualities of a modern data scientist is summed up very nicely in this <a href="http://www.marketingdistillery.com/2014/08/30/data-science-skill-set-explained/">article/guide</a> and image by Marketing Distillery. As they point out, the team should be composed of people with a "mixture of broad, multidisciplinary skills ranging from an intersection of mathematics, statistics, computer science, communication and business". More importantly:

"Being a data scientist is not only about data crunching. It's about understanding the business challenge, creating some valuable actionable insights to the data, and communicating their findings to the business". 

I couldn't agree more!
