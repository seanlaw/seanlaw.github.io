My blog is finally up and running! Currently, it's being hosted (for free) and backed up on <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> pages using vanilla <a href="http://www.jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a>. <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font awesome</a>, which definitely lives up to its name, was used to produce the social icons along the navigation bar and <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> is being used for redundancy. More design customizations will follow but I'm loving how easy the process has been!
