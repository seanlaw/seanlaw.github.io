My new book purchase, [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman arrived in the mail the last week and I'm excited to get reading! Springer was also kind enough to make this classic book available for free of charge on the web. Get your copy [here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)!
