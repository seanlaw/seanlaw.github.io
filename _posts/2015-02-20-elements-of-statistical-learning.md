My new book purchase, [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman arrived in the mail the last week and I'm excited to get reading! Springer was also kind enough to make this classic book available free to download. Get your copy [here](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)! Python implementations of each chapter will be added in the <a href="{{ site.url }}/pyesl.html">PyESL</a> section.
